# sql-data-analytics-project
This project is a comprehensive SQL project that covers data exploration, analytical queries, and reporting. The dataset simulates a real-world business environment, containing detailed information on customers, products, and sales transactions. Through this project, the focus is on uncovering insights into customer behaviour, product performance, and overall sales trends.

This project is divided into two main parts:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This stage focuses on exploring and understanding the data, identifying patterns, spotting anomalies, and forming initial insights. It includes the scripts from files 01 to 06.

2. Advanced Data Analysis
Building on the findings from the EDA, this stage focuses on answering key business questions and extracting deeper insights. This part of the project is implemented through the scripts in files 07 to 12.
